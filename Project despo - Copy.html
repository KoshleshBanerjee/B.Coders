The internet is one of the most recent creation done by a person that has reformed the style of working and living. It has nearly decreased the separation and has broken all the human made boundaries and brought the entire world readily available. Today the web has become so normal that it is promptly accessible in the entire world.
<br>
Due to Covid-19, many changes came to our world and It took some time for everyone to adopt the new normal. The Covid-19 impact was everywhere, which resulted in the closure of Schools and other educational institutions.
<br>
Initially, most governments have decided to temporarily close the schools to reduce the impact of Covid-19. Later it was reopened for a few grades, which increased the number of infection rates and then closed again.
<br>
Though schools are closed, students are attending their classes through various education initiatives like online classrooms, radio programs. Though it is a good thing happening on the other side, there are lots of students who didnâ€™t own the resources to attend the online classes suffer a lot. Many students are struggling to obtain the gadgets required for online classes.
<br>
Teachers who are all experts in Blackboard, Chalk, books, and classroom teaching are really new to this digital teaching, but they are adopting the new methods and handling it like a pro to aid the students in the current position.
